## 🕹 I was intended to make roguelike..

### Description
This is second Greenfoot game I made for ***2017 SOGRA HACKATHON***. Check out the [first Greenfoot game](https://github.com/Yabby1997/StarWars-Edge-of-Galactic-Empire) I made!
+ Language : Java
+ Environment : JVM, [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org)

### Greenfoot
Greenfoot is very simplified version of game engine for teaching object oriented programming with Java. It helped me to understand the concept of objects and Java itself. So I'd like to recommend Greenfoot for beginners.
